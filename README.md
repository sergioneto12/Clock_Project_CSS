# Clock with CSS and JS

## A clock, an ordinary one, but working with our specific hour!

This is a project designed with CSS and JavaScript. Made by Online Tutorials, it's a great way to understand several funcionalities from CSS. Also, it takes
a little amount of JS to work with yout date, not only a tool to look.

The HTML is basically a div basic structure, only to get some references, because all things are made by CSS.

Feel free to clone this repository and use to train your maisn skills and understand what's being made!
